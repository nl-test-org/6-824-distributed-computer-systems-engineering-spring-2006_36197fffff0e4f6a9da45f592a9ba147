Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

A schedule of topics and important due dates are presented in the [calendar](#Calendar).

Structure
---------

6.824 is a core graduate subject with lectures, labs, quizzes, and a final project. 6.824 is 12 units. 6 Engineering Design Points.

Lectures meet two times a week. Most class meetings will be one half lecture and one half paper discussion. You should read the paper **before** coming to class, and be prepared to discuss it. You can find out what paper to read for each meeting given in the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) section.

We will post a question about each paper 24 hours before we discuss the paper. Please bring your answer to class on a sheet of paper and hand it in. Your answer need only be long enough to demonstrate that you understand the paper; a paragraph or two will usually be enough. We won't hand back the questions, but we will glance at them to make sure your answer makes sense, and they will count for part of the paper discussion grade.

6.824 will have two in-class quizzes.

There are programming labs due every week or two for the first half of the term.

In the second half of the term you'll undertake a [project]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/projects) in small teams. Each team will design and implement a system of its choice. Each team will also write a research paper about its project.

Grading
-------

The grade for this class will be based on:

| Activities | Percentages |
| --- | --- |
| Labs (programming assignments) | 25% |
| Project (programming and paper) | 40% |
| Quizzes | 25% |
| Paper discussion, participation, and paper questions | 10% 

### Late Policy

The late policy for programming assignments is as follows. You can hand assignments in late, but the total amount of lateness summed over all the assignments must not exceed 72 hours. If you hand in an assignment late, and your total late time (include the late time for that assignment) exceeds 72 hours, we will give that assignment a grade of D. Note that a D is better than the grade you'd get if you handed in nothing. You can divide up your 72 hours among the assignments however you like; you don't have to ask or tell us. If you want an exception to this rule, please bring us a letter from a dean.

Collaboration Policy
--------------------

You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments, except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution (and you're not allowed to look at solutions from previous years). You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use each other's code.

You may discuss the questions for each discussion paper with other students, but you may not look at other student's answers. You must write your answer yourself.
